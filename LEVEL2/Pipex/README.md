# Description

	In pipex, we have to recreate the behavior of a pipe, one of the most useful tool avalaible in the shell, allowing us to connect inputs and outputs of different processes. 

# Instructions

	To run the program it must be prototyped this way :
		./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2
	
	And mimicks the behavior of such :
		"< infile" "cmd1" | "cmd2" "> outfile"

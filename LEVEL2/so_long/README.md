# Description

	This project makes us use for the first time a graphic library.
	We are required to execute a bigger parsing than ever before, linking it with an
	other way of execution order because of how the library works.
	Furthermore, the use of .xpm makes us have a better view about files import

# Instructions

	To launch it it asks :
		./so_long maps/[mapthatyouwant]

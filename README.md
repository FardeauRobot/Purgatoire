# Purgatoire 🔥

*"And I beheld a great repository, wherein the souls of students were tested and refined through trials of code."*

## The Divine Judgement

In this realm between darkness and enlightenment, thy soul shall be judged upon these sacred projects. Each challenge is a station on the path to redemption, where the worthy ascend and the weak are forged anew.

## The Seven Circles of Trial

### 🔱 **libft** - *The Foundation Stone*
The first trial, wherein thou must forge thine own sacred library. As the prophets built their tools before temples, so must thou craft the fundamental functions that shall sustain thee throughout thy pilgrimage.

**Path**: `libft/`  
**Judgement**: Master the ancient arts of memory, strings, and conversion. Build thy arsenal of utility functions.

---

### 📜 **Get Next Line (GNL)** - *The Scroll of Reading*
The second trial tests thy ability to read from the eternal streams. Line by line, thou shalt parse the sacred texts, for knowledge comes not all at once, but gradually revealed.

**Path**: `GNL/`  
**Judgement**: Read from file descriptors with grace and handle buffers with wisdom.

---

### 🖨️ **ft_printf** - *The Voice of Output*
The third trial grants thee the power of divine expression. Speak thy variables unto the void, format thy numbers and strings with precision.

**Path**: `PRINTF/`  
**Judgement**: Recreate the holy function of formatted output with variadic arguments.

---

### 🔄 **Push_Swap** - *The Algorithm of Penance*
The fourth trial, a test of sorting and optimization. Two stacks stand before thee - arrange the chaos into order with the fewest movements possible. Efficiency is thy salvation.

**Path**: `PushSwap/`  
**Judgement**: Sort integers using only sacred operations (sa, sb, pa, pb, ra, rb, rra, rrb). The fewer thy moves, the closer to grace.

---

### 🎮 **So_Long** - *The Labyrinth of Graphics*
The fifth trial beckons thee into the realm of visual creation. Navigate mazes, render sprites, handle events - thy first communion with the graphical divine.

**Path**: `So_Long/`  
**Judgement**: Create a 2D game using MinilibX, escape the labyrinth and collect thy treasures.

---

### 🤖 **Born2beRoot (B2B)** - *The System Administrator's Covenant*
The sixth trial descends into the depths of system administration. Configure virtual machines, secure thy fortress, understand the scriptures of Linux.

**Path**: `B2B/`  
**Judgement**: Master virtual machines, security policies, and system monitoring.

---

### 📜 **Scripts** - *The Scrolls of Automation*
Sacred incantations and automation spells gathered throughout thy journey. Git workflows, compilation shortcuts, and monitoring tools to ease thy burden.

**Path**: `Scripts/`

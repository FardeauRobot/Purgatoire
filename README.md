# Purgatoire 🔥

*"And I beheld a great repository, wherein the souls of students were tested and refined through trials of code."*

## The Divine Judgement

In this realm between darkness and enlightenment, thy soul shall be judged upon these sacred projects. Each challenge is a station on the path to redemption, where the worthy ascend and the weak are forged anew.

---

## 🔱 Libft - *The Foundation Stone*

Before the ascent begins, thou must forge thine own sacred library. As the prophets built their tools before temples, so must thou craft the fundamental functions that shall sustain thee throughout thy pilgrimage.

**Path**: `libft/`  
**Judgement**: Master the ancient arts of memory, strings, and conversion. Build thy arsenal of utility functions.

---

## ⛰️ LEVEL 1 - *The First Circle of Trial*

The opening trials, where the pilgrim learns to read, to speak, and to guard the gates.

### 📜 **Get Next Line (GNL)** - *The Scroll of Reading*
The trial tests thy ability to read from the eternal streams. Line by line, thou shalt parse the sacred texts, for knowledge comes not all at once, but gradually revealed.

**Path**: `LEVEL1/GNL/`  
**Judgement**: Read from file descriptors with grace and handle buffers with wisdom.

### 🖨️ **ft_printf** - *The Voice of Output*
This trial grants thee the power of divine expression. Speak thy variables unto the void, format thy numbers and strings with precision.

**Path**: `LEVEL1/PRINTF/`  
**Judgement**: Recreate the holy function of formatted output with variadic arguments.

### 🤖 **Born2beRoot (B2B)** - *The System Administrator's Covenant*
This trial descends into the depths of system administration. Configure virtual machines, secure thy fortress, understand the scriptures of Linux.

**Path**: `LEVEL1/B2B/`  
**Judgement**: Master virtual machines, security policies, and system monitoring.

---

## 🏔️ LEVEL 2 - *The Second Circle of Trial*

The trials deepen. Pipes, algorithms, and the graphical arts now stand between thee and salvation.

### 🔗 **Pipex** - *The River of Pipes*
A trial of process creation and interprocess communion. Chain commands as the ancients chained rivers — from one stream unto the next, let data flow unbroken.

**Path**: `LEVEL2/Pipex/`  
**Judgement**: Master pipes, forks, and redirections. Reproduce the sacred shell pipeline.

### 🔄 **Push_Swap** - *The Algorithm of Penance*
A test of sorting and optimization. Two stacks stand before thee — arrange the chaos into order with the fewest movements possible. Efficiency is thy salvation.

**Path**: `LEVEL2/PushSwap/`  
**Judgement**: Sort integers using only sacred operations (sa, sb, pa, pb, ra, rb, rra, rrb). The fewer thy moves, the closer to grace.

### 🎮 **So_Long** - *The Labyrinth of Graphics*
This trial beckons thee into the realm of visual creation. Navigate mazes, render sprites, handle events — thy first communion with the graphical divine.

**Path**: `LEVEL2/So_Long/`  
**Judgement**: Create a 2D game using MinilibX, escape the labyrinth and collect thy treasures.

---

## 📜 Scripts - *The Scrolls of Automation*

Sacred incantations and automation spells gathered throughout thy journey. Git workflows, compilation shortcuts, and monitoring tools to ease thy burden.

**Path**: `Scripts/`

---

## The Commandments

- Thou shalt respect the Norm
- Thou shalt not leak memory
- Thou shalt handle errors with grace
- Thou shalt code with clarity and purpose
- Thou shalt test thoroughly before submission

---

*"Through fire and function calls, through segfaults and success, the student walks the narrow path. Each project completed is a step toward enlightenment, each bug fixed a sin absolved. Welcome, wanderer, to thy Purgatoire."*

**Status**: 🔥 *Refining in progress...*
